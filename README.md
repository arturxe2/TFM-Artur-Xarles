# Mixture Density Networks implementation for distribution and uncertainty estimation
A generic Mixture Density Networks implementation for distribution and uncertainty estimation by using Keras (TensorFlow)

This repository is a collection of [Jupyter](httpsjupyter.org) notebooks intended to solve a lot of problems in which we want to predict a probability distribution by using Mixture Density Network avoiding a NaN problem and other derived problems of the model proposed by [Bishop, C. M. (1994)](httpeprints.aston.ac.uk373). The second major objective of this repository is to look for ways to predict uncertainty by using artificial neural networks.

The whole code, until 20.1.2017, is the result of a final Master's Thesis of the [Master's Degree in Artificial Intelligence](httpwww.upc.edumasterfitxa_master.phpid_estudi=50&lang=esp) supervised by Jordi Vitri√†, PhD. The [Master's Thesis report](httpsgithub.comaxelbrandoMixture-Density-Networks-for-distribution-and-uncertainty-estimationblobmasterABrando-MDN-MasterThesis.pdf) is published in this repository in a PDF format but my idea is to realize a web view of the final master's work in the coming days. To summary all the contents I explained in the report, it is possible to consult the [slides of the presentation](httpsgithub.comaxelbrandoMixture-Density-Networks-for-distribution-and-uncertainty-estimationblobmasterABrando-MDN-Slides.pdf). Any contribution or idea to continue the lines of the proposed work will be very welcome.

emRepresentation of the Mixture Density Network model. The output of the feed-forward neural network determine the parameters in a mixture density model. Therefore, the mixture density model represents the conditional probability density function of the target variables conditioned on the input vector of the neural network.em
